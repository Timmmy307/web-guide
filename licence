(Applies to "Aurora Gateway" and "Firewall Freedom")

Version: 1.0

1. Parties and Scope
This Sirco Proprietary License Agreement (“Agreement”) is between Sirco (“Sirco,” “we,” or “us”) and you (“you” or “Licensee”). It governs your use of Sirco’s proprietary software, including Aurora Gateway and Firewall Freedom, together with any related updates, assets, and documentation (collectively, the “Software”).
By downloading, installing, accessing, or using the Software, you agree to be bound by this Agreement. If you do not agree, do not use the Software.

2. License Grant
Subject to your continuous compliance with this Agreement, Sirco grants you a limited, personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to install and use the Software solely for personal, non-commercial purposes. No rights are granted except as expressly stated in this Agreement.

3. Restrictions
You shall not:
(a) modify, translate, adapt, or create derivative works of the Software;
(b) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to derive source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, or file formats, except to the limited extent permitted by mandatory law;
(c) distribute, publish, share, sell, rent, lease, lend, host, or sublicense the Software, in whole or in part, whether original or modified, to any third party (including uploading to any server or embedding in any product or service);
(d) use the Software without accepting this Agreement or circumvent any technical protections or usage limitations;
(e) use the Software for commercial purposes or in production environments for third parties;
(f) export or re-export the Software in violation of applicable export control or sanctions laws.

4. Ownership and Intellectual Property
The Software is licensed, not sold. Sirco and its licensors own all rights, title, and interest in and to the Software, including all intellectual property rights. You acquire no ownership or other rights beyond the limited license granted herein. You agree not to challenge Sirco’s rights or the validity of Sirco’s intellectual property.

5. Updates and Third-Party Components
Sirco may, but has no obligation to, provide updates or patches. Any such updates are deemed part of the Software and subject to this Agreement. The Software may include or interoperate with third-party components subject to separate terms; those terms govern their respective components in the event of a conflict.

6. No Warranty
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” SIRCO DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. YOU ASSUME ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH USING THE SOFTWARE.

7. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SIRCO WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES; LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SIRCO’S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED US$50 OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID (IF ANY) FOR THE SOFTWARE IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM, WHICHEVER IS GREATER. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW CERTAIN LIMITATIONS; IN SUCH CASES, THE LIMITATIONS APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED.

8. Enforcement and Termination
Sirco may suspend or terminate this license immediately if you breach this Agreement. Upon termination, you must cease all use, uninstall and destroy all copies of the Software, and, upon request, certify destruction. Sirco reserves all rights and remedies at law and in equity.

9. Compliance
Upon reasonable notice, and no more than once per year, Sirco may request written certification of your compliance or conduct a limited review of your use of the Software to verify compliance.

10. Governing Law and Venue
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Illinois, USA, without regard to conflict-of-laws rules. The parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state or federal courts located in Cook County, Illinois, for any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement.

11. Export and Sanctions
You represent that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any country or party subject to U.S. or other applicable export control or sanctions restrictions. You will not use or export the Software in violation of such laws.

12. Entire Agreement; Changes; Waiver; Severability
This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Sirco regarding the Software and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings. Sirco may update this Agreement by publishing a new version; continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance. Failure to enforce any provision is not a waiver. If any provision is held unenforceable, it will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.

13. Acceptance
By downloading, installing, or using the Software, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Agreement.
